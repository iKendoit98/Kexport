# Kexport
Simple Modification of __Jayanams Batex__ exporter.
Used this as a base to learning scripting of blender.



Changes made:
  1. Added a extra button to the TOPBAR
  
  
I plan to expand this addon further to suit my needs
(might even do a full restructure once i get comfortable with blender api and python)
  
I recommended checking out Jayanams addons and breaking it down yourself.
